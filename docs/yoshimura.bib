abstract = {{The number of space debris increases by mutual collision. For this reason, the large-sized space debris with high collision probability needs to be removed as early as possible. We are studying the active removal system of space debris from low earth orbit. The satellite system captures a space debris from a suitable direction by measuring its pose and motion from the near. Then, we propose a technology which measures the pose and motion of target space debris by reduced quantity of required memory data and calculation, by using of single camera images and the eigen space method. Moreover, the result of having verified the technique to propose by the experiment which simulated the lighting environment on orbit using the scale model of the space debris is described.}},

abstract = {{Recently, the increase in amount of space debris is recognized as the obstacle of space development. For an active removal of space debris, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is making various studies, such as the orbit control technique or the capture technique. To remove uncooperative targets like space debris, it is necessary to estimate the motion of them. The purpose of this study is to propose the method to estimate the motion of space debris using the eigen space generated by single camera images. We present the effect of the method to propose by the experiment using the spinning miniature rocket model as large space debris on JAXA's optical simulator.}},
